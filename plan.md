### Step 1: Initialize Core Game State Structure  
```text  
- Build: Basic GameState type with snake array, direction, score, gameOver, won flags. Create /api/reset endpoint to return initial state  
- Outcome: POST to /api/reset returns 200 with valid JSON GameState containing snake length 1 and gameOver:false  
```

### Step 2: Implement Snake Movement Logic  
```text  
- Build: Direction handling and position updates. Add state serialization/deserialization (base64 JSON)  
- Outcome: State shows snake head moving correctly in chosen direction after manual state manipulation  
```

### Step 3: Collision & Win Detection  
```text  
- Build: Wall/self collision checks and length win condition (10). Update gameOver/won flags  
- Outcome: State correctly flags when snake hits wall/self or reaches length 10  
```

### Step 4: Basic OG Image Template  
```text  
- Build: GET /api/image using @vercel/og with static grid and score display  
- Outcome: API returns 200 with image showing 8x8 grid and sample score (use ?state= param)  
```

### Step 5: Frame Action Handling  
```text  
- Build: POST /api/frame handling direction changes via buttonIndex. Validate moves (no 180Â° turns)  
- Outcome: Sending FrameAction with direction buttons modifies state.direction appropriately  
```

### Step 6: Result Screen & Reset Flow  
```text  
- Build: Conditional OG template for win/lose states. Reset button functionality  
- Outcome: GameOver/Won states show correct screen, reset button returns to initial state  
```

### Step 7: State Security Layer  
```text  
- Build: AES-256-GCM encryption for state param. Validate Farcaster message signatures  
- Outcome: Tampered state params trigger reset, valid signed messages process correctly  
```

### Step 8: Edge Case Handling  
```text  
- Build: Invalid move protection, session expiration (5min), deserialization error recovery  
- Outcome: Invalid moves maintain previous direction, expired sessions show reset prompt  
```

### Step 9: Performance Optimizations  
```text  
- Build: State compression (brotli), CDN caching headers, client-side prediction  
- Outcome: State param size reduced by 50%, Cache-Control headers present in image responses  
```

### Step 10: Accessibility Features  
```text  
- Build: Add ARIA labels, contrast ratios, and touch targets in OG template  
- Outcome: Image HTML includes aria-label attributes, color contrast ratio >4.5:1 verified  
```

### Step 11: Full Integration Test  
```text  
- Build: End-to-end test of all user flows (play to win, play to lose, reset)  
- Outcome: Full game cycle works via frame buttons with proper state transitions and visuals  
```
